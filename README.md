This program is an exercise of various functions such as list, sets, and dictionaries. The first set of 
functions is a list and code that uses arithematic operations with the numbers within the list such as
multiplication in the example. The next exercise was in relation to sets in which given numbers (1-4) where
placed in a list. Once run, it shows the numbers in the set from range 3-10. So numbers 3 and 4 were shown.
The next part was a second list, and the first and second lists were subtracted from each other. The result
was the numbers that were in the second list were taken from the first list leaving 1-3. The next exercise
was in relation to dictionaries within Python. The exercise was to create my own dictionary regarding a 
bicycle. You should be able to list each variable defined in the dictionary as well as pull out individual
variables. There is also the ability to edit variables in the dictionary as well as add variables after
completion. The next few exercises included defining variables. The code for the leap year listed given
years and then showed if they would be leap years or not. The next one included a list of numbers within
a range (0-10), and depending on if the number was divisible by 3 or 2 or both, it would print fizz, buzz,
or fizzbuzz respectively. The final exercise put it all together, defining locations as well as options
and once ran, it gives a list of the options and gives the user an opportunity to input an answer. Depending
on the answer, a number will be returned detailing the location based on the choice.
